On the sale of the vehicle company provides one year base warranty on its parts and also provides 
optional one year extended warranty on additional cost. If the customer has not opted for the 
extended warranty option then after the one year in case of any failure of any part, the warranty is 
said to be expired and all the expenses has to be incurred by the customer itself and company will not 
take any responsibility for the same.
On the other hand, if the vehicle is secured by extended warranty assurance, then after the 
one year from the sale i.e. after the base warranty period, if any failure happens then the affected 
part/parts is/are either repaired or replaced under the warranty terms of the company and all the 
expenses will be done by the company.
